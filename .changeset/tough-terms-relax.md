#### Code Refactoring

- Removed symbols that were indicating if the value is generated by the tracedFabric.

- Removed TTracedFabricValue type. Originally it was used to indicate that value is generated by the tracedFabric and it is traced. Now isTraced functions is a replacement for it (see New features).

#### New features

- Added isTraced. It checks if the given value is traced by the tracedFabric, and changes are recorded.

- Added isTracedRootValue. It checks if the given value is a root value of the tracedFabric.

- Added isTracedValue. It checks if the given value is a traced value, but not a root value.
